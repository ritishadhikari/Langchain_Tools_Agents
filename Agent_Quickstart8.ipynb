      "Summary: The Iran–Israel war (13 – 24 June 2025), also known as the Twelve-Day War, was an armed conflict in the Middle East. The war began when Israel bombed military and nuclear facilities in Iran in a surprise attack, assassinating prominent military leaders, nuclear scientists, and politicians, killing civilians, and damaging or destroying air defenses. Iran retaliated with over 550 ballistic missiles and over 1,000 suicide drones, hitting civilian population centers, one hospital and at least twelve military, energy, and government sites. The United States intercepted Iranian attacks, and bombed three Iranian nuclear sites on 22 June. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at a US base in Qatar. On 24 June, Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire under US pressure.\n",
      "The war followed a decades-long proxy war. Iran has called for Israel's destruction, and armed Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Furthermore, Iran's nuclear program has caused international concern for over a decade and Israel considers it an existential threat. In 2015, under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), six countries lifted sanctions on Iran, which froze its nuclear program. In 2018, US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the plan. Iran began stockpiling enriched uranium and largely suspended International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring. The day before Israel attacked, the IAEA declared Iran non-compliant with its nuclear obligations in a resolution put forward by the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Following the October 7 attacks in 2023, both Hamas and Hezbollah entered into open conflict with Israel. In April 2024, Israel bombed Iran's consulate in Damascus, Syria, killing senior Iranian military officials. Direct conflict continued in April and October.\n",
      "Israel's attacks, which reportedly involved commando units and Mossad operatives in Iran, killed several of Iran's military leaders, leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and at least 10 leading nuclear scientists. The war saw Internet blackouts by the Iranian government. Israeli and US airstrikes damaged the nuclear facilities at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow. Iran's nuclear facilities were extensively damaged. Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA, which it said had passed information about nuclear facilities and scientists to Israel. Iran's total death toll has been estimated at between 1,060 and 1,190; thousands were wounded, tens of thousands were displaced, and the government ordered Internet blackouts. Israel struck a hospital, and high-rise buildings, including apartments. Iranian missiles struck military and government sites, apartments, a research center, and a hospital. Tightened censorship in Israel made the extent of physical damage unclear.\n",
      "The United Nations and most countries expressed deep concern over Israel's strikes and called for a diplomatic solution. The strikes were condemned by many countries, including most Muslim-majority and Arab states, including Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Turkey. Israel's strikes were also condemned by Armenia, Brazil, Cuba, Japan, Russia, and South Africa. The International Commission of Jurists and some other legal scholars saw the Israeli strikes as a violation of international law. Meanwhile, Argentina, Germany, Ukraine, and the United States said the strikes on Iran were justified to prevent nuclear proliferation and said Iran should agree to a nuclear deal promptly.\n",

Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly is the legislative arm of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir. At present, it consists of 95 members, directly elected from 95 constituencies. The tenure of the Legislative Assembly is five years unless dissolved sooner.\n",
      "Prior to 2019, the State of Jammu and Kashmir had a bicameral legislature with a legislative assembly (lower house) and a legislative council (upper house). The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, passed by the Parliament of India in August 2019, replaced this with a unicameral legislature while also re-organising the state into a union territory.

The results of the elections were announced on 8 October 2024. The INDIA alliance won a majority of seats in the election, winning 49 of the 90 seats for which elections were held, with the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) winning the highest number of seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the second largest number of seats and the largest share of the popular vote.\n",
      "This was the first assembly election in over a decade, and the first since the territory's special status was revoked, its statehood withdrawn, martial curfew imposed and over 300 political leaders detained or under house arrest in 2019. Indian government indefinitely suspended elections, for stabilizing the conditions in Kashmir Valley due to the decades long ongoing armed insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. A Supreme Court plea challenging this was brought forward by Panthers Party in May 2023. In December 2023, the Supreme Court directed the Election Commission of India to restore the democratic process by 30 September 2024. The order also upheld the revocation of article 370 and deemed it to be within the laws set by the constitution. Foreign diplomats were allowed to observe the election but foreign journalists were kept out.\n",
      "JKNC emerged as the single largest party, winning 42 seats in total, while BJP came second with 29 seats won. The Indian National Congress (INC) won 6 seats, Jammu and Kashmir People’s Democratic Party (JKPDP) won 3 seats, while Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), Jammu and Kashmir People's Conference and Aam Aadmi Party won one seat each. 7 seats were won by independent candidates. After BJP's 25.64% largest share of the popular vote, JKNC won the second largest share at 23.43%. The INC and JKPDP got 11.97% and 8.87% of the votes respectively, with remaining 30.09% going to other parties, independents and NOTA (none of the above). Coincidentally, this was the worst performance of the Indian National Congress, winning just 6 out of the 38 seats it contested and garnering a vote share of 11.97%.
