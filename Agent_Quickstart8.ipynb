      "Summary: An armed conflict between Iran and Israel began on 13 June 2025, when Israel launched surprise attacks on key military and nuclear facilities in Iran. In the opening hours of the war, Israeli air and ground forces assassinated some of Iran's prominent military leaders, nuclear scientists, and politicians; and damaged or destroyed Iran's air defenses and some of its nuclear and military facilities. Iran retaliated by launching missiles at cities and military sites in Israel. The Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen also fired several missiles at Israel, in an adjunct of the Red Sea crisis. The United States, which defended Israel against Iranian missiles and drones, took offensive action on the ninth day of the war by striking three Iranian nuclear sites. The Houthis took the American strikes as a \"declaration of war\" and unilaterally ended their ceasefire with the United States. \n",
      "The conflict is considered an escalation of decades-long animosity between Israel and Iran, including a proxy conflict, during which Iran challenged Israel's legitimacy and called for its destruction. It also follows more than a decade of international concern about Iran's nuclear program, which Israel considers an existential threat. In 2015, six countries negotiated with Iran a nuclear deal that lifted sanctions on Iran and froze Iran's nuclear program, but in 2018, US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from and voided the deal, after which Iran began stockpiling enriched uranium and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) lost most of its ability to monitor Iran's nuclear facilities. During the crisis in the Middle East that followed the October 7 attacks in 2023 and the ensuing Gaza war, Israel weakened Iranian proxies such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Direct conflict began in April 2024 when Israel bombed the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, killing senior Iranian officials, and the countries traded strikes in April and October. On 12 June 2025, the IAEA passed a resolution drafted by the US, UK, France and Germany that declared Iran non-compliant with its nuclear obligations. Israel began strikes one day later.\n",
      "The Israeli attacks, which reportedly involved commando units and Mossad operatives in Iran, killed several of Iran's military leaders, leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), at least 10 leading nuclear scientists, and more than 600 Iranian civilians, according to the Iranian Health Ministry and the anti-government Human Rights Activists in Iran News Agency. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said more than 70 Iranian women and children were killed in the first three attacks. The war saw internet blackouts by the Iranian regime, and tens of thousands of civilians displaced. Israeli and US airstrikes damaged the nuclear facilities at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow. Israel also hit a missile complex near Tabriz, the Kermanshah Underground Missile Facility, and IRGC facilities near Tehran and in Piranshahr. The attacks also damaged public infrastructure, including a hospital in Kermanshah. The first wave of Iranian retaliation included about 100 missiles and 100 drones. Those and later retaliation strikes killed 24 people, all civilians; Iranian missiles have hit civilian apartments, a university, and a hospital. Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been damaged, but its stockpile of enriched uranium has likely been moved, and Iran likely retains most of it. A US intelligence assessment said that Iran's nuclear program has been set back by only a few months.\n",
      "Legal scholars saw the Israeli strikes as a violation of international law. The attacks were condemned by Bolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Russia, and South Africa. The initial attacks by Israel were condemned by countries across the Islamic world, including Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Turkey. Israel's attacks were met with approval by Germany, Ukraine, and the United States, who said Iran should agree to a nuclear deal promptly.
